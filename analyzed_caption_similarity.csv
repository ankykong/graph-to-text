King of the developers In its early years in the social gaming world, King relied on in-game advertising and micro-transactions to generate revenue. The latter enabled players to make in-game purchases to improve their virtual world or help them past a particularly tricky level. However, in a move to win over its legion of fans, the company decided to remove all in-game advertising in June 2013 and focused on micro-transactions to bring in the money. This strategy seemed to pay off as the monthly active users of King continued to increase and peaked at 550 million users at the beginning of 2015.

Currency exchange rates â€?additional information A currency exchange rate expresses how much a given currency is worth in another currency. Every country has its own currency, which is used locally as a means of payment for goods and services. An exception is the euro zone, a coalition of European countries, where the euro is the common currency used. The euro was first introduced on the financial markets on January 1st, 1999 and it replaced the domestic currencies of the eleven countries which initially participated in the creation of the euro zone. Maintaining the stability of a currency is one of the most relevant tasks of a government. Significant fluctuations of a currency can deteriorate the value of international trade, capital flows, interest rates, business revenues (if part of the company operations are carried out abroad), foreign-currency mortgages or returns and investments. One of the most common ways of measuring the change in the value of currency is comparing its purchase parity in different time periods.

Revenge porn is the act of sharing private sexual images or videos of a person without his/her consent, usually in an attempt to harm or punish him or her. Such pictures or videos are generally shared on specific platforms or closed groups on social media, yet can also be sent through regular texting apps. The psychological harm of such a violation can be devastating for the victim and even push the person to commit suicide. Acting against revenge porn Facing the frequency of such acts and the media coverage that some cases receive, the Italian government acted. From 2018 to 2019, four draft laws on criminalizing revenge porn were presented by different Italian politicians. According to a survey conducted in 2018, roughly 78 percent of Italian women and 65,5 percent of Italian men perceived such laws as a social achievement. In July 2019, a law on revenge porn was passed by the Italian parliament. Different forms of sexual violence Being recognized as a crime, revenge porn became a particular instance of sexual violence. Although the violence is psychological rather than physical, the potential harms are equal. In 2018, almost five thousand sexual violence cases were reported to the authorities in Italy. This figure was likely to be an underestimation as many victims of abuse do not report themselves. In the same year, a survey revealed that 77 percent of respondents in Italy believed that a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment was essential to change society.

In particular, 56 percent listened to pop music, followed by 56.1 percent who consumed rock music. Hip Hop was the next most popular genre with 37.4 percent, and was closely followed by R & B and Soul. "," According to a study carried out by Deezer in May 2018, the most popular genre among Americans was rock music, with 56.8 percent of respondents stating that they were currently listening to music within this genre as of the date of survey. Pop and country music were the second and third most popular genres respectively, and 20.2 percent of respondents said they preferred jazz. The appeal of rock and pop music The broad appeal of rock and pop music can in part be attributed to how both genres often blend seamlessly into one another and influence other music styles. Heavy rock bands like Led Zeppelin and AC/DC are often more divisive than melodic rock groups like Bon Jovi or Genesis, just like pop music which strays into R&B territory or is better associated with hip hop or EDM. Each have their appeal to fans with different tastes, and the versatility of rock and pop (and music which combines the two) allows such music to reach adults of all ages and backgrounds. Rock albums also account for the majority of vinyl album sales in the United States, with pop albums ranking second. However, although the resurgence of vinyl has to a certain extent been reliant on the rock genre, this is not the case when it comes to digital music consumption. Rap and hip hop accounted for 22.8 percent of music video streams in the U.S. in 2018, whereas for rock music videos the share was just 7.1 percent. Rock fared similarly when it came to audio streams, once again losing out to rap and hip hop. Taking such data into consideration, it would seem that rock music fans are generally more drawn to traditional formats and are less inclined to enjoy their music via streaming platforms.

A very noticeable plunge was observed from 2008 to 2009, when population growth was almost halved. Reasons for this decline are manifold, it is speculated that is was caused by the economic crisis taking place simultaneously. The collapse of the job and real estate markets may have led the Spanish to postpone having (more) kids or to migrate to other countries in search of a more stable economy. This theory is supported by data on the average age of Spainâ€™s inhabitants; a look at the median age of Spainâ€™s population from 1950 up until today shows that the Spanish get older on average â€?perhaps due to the aforementioned factors.
