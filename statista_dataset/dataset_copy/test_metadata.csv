In 2020, the total population of Spain was around 46.49 million people. Population of Spain While Spainâ€™s fertility rate has been relatively steady over the past decade, its year-over-year population growth has been declining continuously at the same time. A very noticeable plunge was observed from 2008 to 2009, when population growth was almost halved. Reasons for this decline are manifold, it is speculated that is was caused by the economic crisis taking place simultaneously. The collapse of the job and real estate markets may have led the Spanish to postpone having (more) kids or to migrate to other countries in search of a more stable economy. This theory is supported by data on the average age of Spainâ€™s inhabitants; a look at the median age of Spainâ€™s population from 1950 up until today shows that the Spanish get older on average â€?perhaps due to the aforementioned factors. Speaking of Spainâ€™s economy, economic key factors suggest that the country is still recovering from the crisis. Its gross domestic product (GDP) was in admirable shape prior to the collapse, but it still has not returned to its former glory. Only recently has Spain reported actual GDP growth since 2008, it remains to be seen if this is going to translate into a positive trend over the next few years.

statista_dataset/dataset_copy/imgs/1241.png," Founded in Sweden in 2003, King is a video game developer that is most famous for its blockbuster gaming hit, Candy Crush Saga.

King of the developers In its early years in the social gaming world, King relied on in-game advertising and micro-transactions to generate revenue. The latter enabled players to make in-game purchases to improve their virtual world or help them past a particularly tricky level. However, in a move to win over its legion of fans, the company decided to remove all in-game advertising in June 2013 and focused on micro-transactions to bring in the money. This strategy seemed to pay off as the monthly active users of King continued to increase and peaked at 550 million users at the beginning of 2015. However, the MAU figure has been steadily falling in the ensuing years and the company was acquired in February 2016 by Activision Blizzard, famed for games such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch, in a deal worth almost six billion U.S. dollars.

Currency exchange rates â€?additional information A currency exchange rate expresses how much a given currency is worth in another currency. Every country has its own currency, which is used locally as a means of payment for goods and services. An exception is the euro zone, a coalition of European countries, where the euro is the common currency used. The euro was first introduced on the financial markets on January 1st, 1999 and it replaced the domestic currencies of the eleven countries which initially participated in the creation of the euro zone. Maintaining the stability of a currency is one of the most relevant tasks of a government. Significant fluctuations of a currency can deteriorate the value of international trade, capital flows, interest rates, business revenues (if part of the company operations are carried out abroad), foreign-currency mortgages or returns and investments. One of the most common ways of measuring the change in the value of currency is comparing its purchase parity in different time periods. The indicator used for this purpose is called the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which reflects the price of goods and services in a household. If, within one year, the price of the goods and services basket changes from 1,000 U.S. dollars to 1,050 U.S. dollars, it means that the inflation rate was equal to five percent and that the purchase power of the U.S. dollar decreased during this period.

For 2018, estimates show a sharp increase of over 3.07 percent, before inflation slumps back to around 2 percent in 2021. Oil is keeping everything afloat The economy of the United Arab Emirates heavily relies on oil and its respective revenues. The UAE possess vast stable oil reserves, and crude oil production is steadily increasing. Naturally, oil exports â€?mostly to the Asia-Pacific region â€?are the main economic driver, and the industrial and services sectors have divided generation of GDP almost evenly among themselves. Oil has caused the UAE economy to thrive and caused an impressive trade surplus just a few years ago, before a dramatic (but still not overly concerning) slump. Oil is dragging everything down When oil prices decreased, so did the trade surplus, and inflation mirrored this by skyrocketing from around one percent to over four percent in three years. Another three years later, in 2018, it spiked again at over 3.5 percent â€?another response to dropping oil prices. Diversifying the economy is one way for the UAE to diminish oilâ€™s monopoly; tourism has been a growing industry over the last few years and might just stabilize inflation if another oil price slump hits.
