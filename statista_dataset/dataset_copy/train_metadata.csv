In 2019, around 5.13 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions were produced from energy consumption in the United States. In 2018, around 36.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide was emitted globally. U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption The year 1997 marked the birth of the Kyoto Protocol. That year, global energy-related CO2 emissions stood at around 24.4 billion metric tons. Despite numerous assurances by policymakers to undertake efforts to reduce pollution, this figure increased to more than 36 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2017. North America and the Asia Pacific regions are presently the biggest producers of carbon dioxide emissions as a result of a growing thirst for energy derived from fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal. China is currently the most polluting country in the world , with a 27.5 percent share of global CO2 emissions in 2018. A comparative analysis between CO2 levels in 1993 and those in 2003 shows that emission levels in China have more than tripled in a span of ten years. According to a recent forecast, energy-related global CO2 emissions from the consumption of coal, natural gas and liquid fuels are set to rise to unprecedented levels through 2040, while U.S. CO2 emissions produced by the use of natural gas are set to grow from 1.68 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2019 to 1.97 billion metric tons in 2050.

statista_dataset/dataset_copy/imgs/15574.png," In 1844, Romania had a population of just 3.6 million people. During the early entries in this data, Romania's borders were very different and much smaller than today, and control of this area often switched hands between the Austrian, Ottoman and Russian empires. The populations during this time are based on estimates made for incomplete census data, and they show that the population grows from 3.6 million in 1844, doubling to 7.2 million in 1912, part of this growth is due to a high natural birth rate during this period, but also partly due to the changing of Romania's borders and annexation of new lands. During this time Romania gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire as a result of the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, and experienced a period of increased stability and progress. Between 1912 and 1930 the population of Romania grew by over 10 million people. The main reason for this is the huge territories gained by Romania in the aftermath of the First World War. During the war Romania remained neutral for the first two years, after which it joined the allies; however, it was very quickly defeated and overrun by the Central Powers, and in total it lost over 600 thousand people as a direct result of the war. With the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires after the war, Romania gained almost double it's territory, which caused the population to soar to 18.1 million in 1930. The population then decreases by 1941 and again by 1948, as Romania seceded territory to neighboring countries and lost approximately half a million people during the Second World War. From 1948 onwards the population begins to grow again, reaching it's peak at 23.5 million people in 1990. Like many other Eastern European countries, there was very limited freedom of movement from Romania during the Cold War, and communist rule was difficult for the Romanian people. The Romanian Revolution in 1989 ended communist rule in the country, Romania transitioned to a free-market society and movement from the country was allowed.

This is down from a fairly high spike in 2016, expected to converge to a steady state around 6 percent in the coming years. For a developing economy, this is an acceptable level, though Myanmarâ€™s central bankers would probably prefer one or two percentage points less. What is inflation? Inflation is the rise in prices over time. This is often caused by economic growth, and economists consider low, stable growth to be a sign of a healthy economy. The unemployment rate can also cause inflation if it is too low because businesses have to offer higher wages to attract workers. The firms raise prices to pay these higher wages, driving up inflation. Myanmar may be different While the unemployment rate is very low, other indicators may reveal that the labor market still has some slack. Myanmar does not publish the workforce particiaption rate, but one can infer by the low rate of urbanization that many workers may engage in subsistance agriculture or simply not search for jobs, keeping them out of the unemployment statistic. Similarly, the low gross domestic product (GDP) per capita may cause workers to stay with a job that is not a good match simply because they do not think they can find another. The hope is that the higher inflation rate will have upward pressure on wages, bringing more wealth to the people of Myanmar. ",line,Unnamed: 0,Inflation rate compared to previous year

statista_dataset/dataset_copy/imgs/4124.png," Including President-elect Joe Biden, the United States has had 46 presidents since George Washington's election in 1789. While Washington himself was not affiliated with any political party, and even argued against partisanship (something that the other Founding Fathers agreed with), political differences and personal rivalries between the Founding Fathers eventually led to the founding of the Federalist Party, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Thomas Jefferson. Washington's successor, John Adams, was the only Federalist president, before the Democratic-Republicans occupied the White House from 1801 until 1829. Formation of the Democratic and Republican parties The 1820s again saw political and personal rivalries lead to a split among the country's leadership, and the Democratic-Republican Party made way for the formation of the Democratic Party and the National Republican Party. The Democratic Party was formed by Andrew Jackson and his supporters, and was traditionally the more conservative of the major political parties in the U.S. until the mid-twentieth century. The National Republican Party was short lived, and eventually amalgamated with the Whig Party in the 1830s, who would go on to be the main opposition to the Democratic Party for the subsequent two decades. Four U.S. presidents belonged to the Whig Party, although it may be important to note that these four men only served a combined eight years in office, as two of them died a short while into their tenure. The issue of slavery was the most dominant and divisive issue in U.S. politics in the mid-nineteenth century, and regional splits emerged in both parties; the rifts did not break apart the Democratic Party, who favored state sovereignty on the issue, whereas the divide in the Whig Party saw it splinter into the right-wing Know Nothing Party in the south, and anti-slavery Republican Party in the north. The 1856 election was the first to feature candidates of both the Democratic and Republican Parties, marking the beginning of the major political rivalry that has dominated U.S. politics for the past 160 years. Realignment Abraham Lincoln became the U.S.' first Republican president with his victory in the 1860 election. From then until 1933, twelve of the U.S.' 16 presidents belonged to the Republican Party, while just four* were from the Democratic Party. Due to the legacy left by the American Civil War, the southern, former-Confederate states were a political stronghold for the Democratic Party, and rarely voted for Republican candidates in presidential elections; in contrast to this, the north, west and newly-admitted states tended to vote Republican. In the 1910s, the Republican Party transitioned into the more ideologically conservative option of the two major parties, and more fiscally conservative following the Great Depression; however, it was not until the Johnson administration in the 1960s, particularly due to matters regarding African-American civil rights, where the core voter bases switched into what is typically expected today. In the past century, there have been ten Republican and nine Democratic presidents (including Joe Biden), with Democrats occupying the White House for roughly 52 of these years. Republican voters in the twenty-first century are generally more conservative and right-leaning in regards to both economic and social issues, whereas Democratic voters tend to be the opposite. There are also strong correlations between political parties and their voters, based on issues such as location, ethnicity, wealth, education and age. ",pie,Unnamed: 0,Number of presidents

The beginning of the current era of increasing economic globalization was signaled in by the creation of the Bretton Woods institutions towards the end of the Second World War. These institutions acted as the foundation for the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization. The institutions, and their modern equivalents, sought to reduce the barriers on international trade in goods, services and capital markets. In the decades following their inception international trade has skyrocketed to become a cornerstone of the international economy, as demonstrated by trends in global export volume of trade in goods from 1950 to 2017. Countries that are perceived as more economically globalized are those with low tariffs on imports, more free-trade agreements, regulation that accommodates foreign investment and lower non-tariff barriers to trade such as safety regulations on imports.

statista_dataset/dataset_copy/imgs/1036.png," Iranâ€™s inflation rate rose sharply to 41.02 percent in 2019 and was projected to rise another six percentage points before slowly starting to decline. Given the recent sanctions by the United States regarding the nuclear deal, this number has both political and economic implications. Political implications President Hassan Rouhani won the 2017 election based on economic promises, many stemming from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. Lifting these sanctions opened the Iranian economy to many opportunities, including the chance to benefit from increased oil exports. The JCPOA was an integral part of the Rouhani campaign, so any economic hardship that is linked to the deal will likely be blamed on the president. Economic implications High inflation leads to high interest rates, which leads to less borrowing. Less borrowing means less investment, which slows economic growth. This slower growth often leads to higher inflation, which is what economists call an inflationary spiral. As such, Iran will have difficulty achieving substantial GDP growth until inflation returns to manageable rates. ",line,Unnamed: 0,Inflation rate

Population development in China As of mid 2018, China was the country with the largest population worldwide, closely followed by India, which ranked second with a population of about 1.37 billion people. As population growth in India is higher than in China, India will soon become the most populous country in the world. Due to several mechanisms put into place by the Chinese government as well as changing circumstances in the working and social environment of the Chinese people, population growth has subsided over the past decades, displaying an annual population growth rate of merely around 0.5 percent in recent years. Nevertheless, compared to the world population in total, China held a share of about 19 percent of the overall global population in 2010. China's aging population In terms of demographic developments, the birth control efforts of the Chinese government had considerable effects on the demographic pyramid in China. Upon closer examination of the age distribution, a clear trend of an aging population becomes visible. In order to curb the negative effects of an aging population, the Chinese government abolished the one-child policy in 2015, which had been in effect since 1979.

The number of births in China varied in the years following the abolishment of the one-child policy, but did not increase considerably.

The United States demanded 21.6 percent of the world's total silver production. Consumption of silver Silver is one of the worldâ€™s most valued metals and included within the so called transition metals group. Within living memory, this precious metal always has been used for coins, jewellery and valuable utensils, known as silverware. In modern times, it also developed an important role in industrial usage. Almost half of all silver worldwide is used for such purposes. This is primarily due to its extremely high electric and thermal conductivity. In fact, silver has the highest conductivity of electricity and heat of all elements and metals, respectively. Thus, industrial silver usage is mostly for conductors and catalyses. Another sector which is highly dependent on silver is the photographic industry. Silver is also an important factor within the finance and investment sector. Among countries around the world, the United States is the top consumer of silver. The United States consumes around one fifth of global silver. China, Japan and India are following, while Germany and Italy are the top consumers from Europe.

Saudi Aramco led the ranking of the world's most profitable companies in 2019, with a net income of 88.21 billion U.S. dollars. How are market value and market capitalization determined? Market value and market capitalization are two terms frequently used â€?and confused - when discussing the profitability and viability of companies. Strictly speaking, market capitalization (or market cap) is the worth of a company based on the total value of all their shares; an important metric when determining the comparative value of companies for trading opportunities. Accordingly, many stock exchanges such as the New York or London Stock Exchange release market capitalization data on their listed companies. On the other hand, market value technically refers to what a company is worth in a much broader context. It is determined by multiple factors, including profitability, corporate debt, and the market environment as a whole. In this sense it aims to estimate the overall value of a company, with share price only being one element. Market value is therefore useful for determining whether a companyâ€™s shares are over- or undervalued, and in arriving at a price if the company is to be sold. Such valuations are generally made on a case-by-case basis though, and not regularly reported. For this reason, market capitalization is often reported as market value. What are the top companies in the world? The answer to this question depends on the metric used. Although one of the largest companies by market capitalization, Appleâ€™s global revenue did not manage to crack the top ten of companies. Rather, American multinational retailer Walmart was ranked number of the worldâ€™s largest companies in the world by revenue. Walmart also had the highest number of employees in the world.

In 2018, Ukraine's GDP amounted to approximately 391.42 billion international dollars. See the Russian GDP for comparison. Ukraine's rocky economy In just two years, between 2013 and 2015, GDP in Ukraine has been dramatically reduced to half its amount. This very severe decrease is mainly due to the armed conflict in the eastern part of the country, which is causing many of its inhabitants to be internally displaced, and life in general to become increasingly difficult for Ukrainians - not just because of the war, but because the countryâ€™s economy is in desperate trouble: The inflation rate has risen to almost 50 percent, the second highest rate around the world behind Venezuela, and unemployment is now at over 11 percent. The industrial Donbass region located to the east of the country has also been devastated. Russia, Ukraineâ€™s most important import and export partner until recently, most likely no longer plays this role, having caused a great shift in the countryâ€™s base economy.

Inflation in the U.S. Inflation is a term used to describe a general rise in the price of goods and services in an economy over a given period of time. Inflation in the United States is calculated using the consumer price index (CPI). The consumer price index is a measure of change in the price level of a preselected market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households.

statista_dataset/dataset_copy/imgs/7474.png," Until the late-medieval period, Roman numerals were the most common way of displaying numerical data in Europe. It was only when (primarily Italian) traders and scholars, such as the mathematician Fibonacci, returned from their travels in Asia and North Africa that our current system of Arabic numerals became more popular in Europe. The main reason being their easier usage for calculations, including decimalization. No Zero Another major difference between Arabic and Roman numerals is the ability to represent nothing. Arabic numerals include the number 0 (zero), whereas there was no Roman equivalent to this. In the middle ages and earlier, zero was written as the word ""nulla"". Early mathematicians, such as Aristotle, also dismissed the idea of having a numerical zero, as it could not be used to multiply or divide. When Arab mathematicians tried to introduce the concept of zero to Europe in the eighth century, it was met with resistance, and in later centuries the use of zero and other Arabic numerals was made illegal for European bankers, as this was seen as a foreign challenge to the traditional system of numbers. Why 3,999? One further advantage of the Arabic system is that numbers are much shorter when they get to higher values. For example, the number 3,888 is written as ""MMMDCCCLXXXVIII "" in Roman numerals, which is fifteen individual numerals. In order to prevent the numbers from becoming too long, Roman mathematicians opted to draw a line above the base integers (V, X, L, etc.) to show that the number had been multiplied by one thousand. This means that the number 4,000 would be written as 'IV' with a short line above it (4,001 would be written as 'IVI' with a horizontal line above the 'IV' only, and not the second 'I').

In 2019, Afghanistan's average inflation rate amounted to 2.3 percent compared to the previous year. Afghanistan's economy Inflation in Afghanistan has experienced an increase every year with the exception of 2009. Some short-term increases in prices are often attributed to wars, which is a fundamental reason for yearly inflation in Afghanistan. On the other hand, wars often cause spikes in GDP, primarily due to an increased amount of production and reparations. This was not the case for Afghanistan, however. GDP, more specifically GDP per capita, remained relatively low as of 2013, despite increasing annually and ranked as one of the top 20 lowest gross domestic product per capita values in 2013. GDP per capita measures a countryâ€™s productivity by using its entire gross domestic product and dividing it by the number of people in the country and is mostly used to compare one nation with another. From an economic standpoint, Afghanistan imported many more goods than they exported, leading to a trade deficit. The country has experienced a trade deficit every year over the past decade, most notably in 2011. Reasons for the ongoing deficit could potentially be the lack of government support for domestic production as well as stiff rules towards marketing. Also, production and transport are likely to suffer due to the war. A trade deficit also implicates that a country borrows more money from other nations in order to sustain and fulfill the needs its economy, along with its citizens.
